# Even-Odd Thread Synchronization in Java

## Overview

This Java project demonstrates inter-thread communication and synchronization using the `synchronized` keyword along with `wait()` and `notify()` methods. The system consists of two threads that take turns operating on a shared resource. One thread handles even numbers, while the other thread processes the corresponding odd numbers.

## Problem Statement

Two threads must work together using a shared object:
- The **Even thread** generates and writes even numbers to the shared resource.
- The **Odd thread** waits for the even number, increments it by 1, and prints the result as an odd number.
- Proper coordination ensures that the two threads execute in strict alternation without race conditions or data inconsistencies.

## How It Works

- A shared resource holds a value and a control flag (`isChanged`) to indicate whether an even number has been written.
- The Even thread waits if the odd thread hasn't processed the last value yet.
- The Odd thread waits if there is no new even number to process.
- Synchronization is achieved through the use of Java’s intrinsic locks and monitor methods (`wait()` and `notify()`).
- This coordination allows the two threads to execute in a predictable, alternating fashion.

## Expected Output

The program prints even and odd numbers in sequence, like:
```

even: 0
Odd: 1
even: 2
Odd: 3
...

```

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Thread creation and management
- Synchronized access to shared resources
- Inter-thread communication using `wait()` and `notify()`
- State-based coordination using flags
- Basic producer-consumer problem pattern

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later
- Any IDE or command-line environment that supports Java

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files.
2. Run the main class that starts both threads.
3. Observe the orderly output of even and odd numbers.

## Use Case

This project serves as a simple demonstration of thread synchronization patterns and is useful for learners to understand how inter-thread signaling and data sharing work in real-world Java applications.
